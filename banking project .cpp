# Banking System in C++
This project is designed as a learning tool to demonstrate the basic principles of object-oriented programming (OOP) in C++. It implements a simple banking system with the following features:
- Account creation and management
- Deposit, withdrawal, and balance enquiry functionalities
- Basic file handling to persist account data
- Exception handling for errors such as insufficient funds

This project is an excellent starting point for understanding C++ and file operations in real-world applications.
